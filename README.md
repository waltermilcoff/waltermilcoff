Hello!!! I'm Walter, I tell you that most of the people need at some point, or as part of their daily activities, a computer to perform specific tasks. The orders that are given to the device are executed thanks to a set of resources of the operating system known as software. The IT developer is the creative mind in charge of creating these resources that allow the operating system of a computer to manage programs and applications, with which the user performs different tasks. Thanks to a developer you can play a game on your PC, watch movies, create spreadsheets, use the browser or make presentations with images and sound, among many other applications. But software is not exclusive to computers, cell phones, tablets, televisions and other smart devices also work with software.
